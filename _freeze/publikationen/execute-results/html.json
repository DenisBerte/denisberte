Many adolescents experiencing suicidal ideation turn to online communities for social support. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated the communication-language style, contents and user activity-in 7975 unique posts and 51,119 comments by N&#x2009;=&#x2009;2862 active adolescent users in a large suicidal ideation support community (SISC) on the social media website reddit.com in the onset period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found significant relative changes in language style markers for hopelessness such as negative emotion words (+&#x2009;10.00%) and positive emotion words (-&#xa0;3.45%) as well as for social disengagement such as social references (-&#xa0;8.63%) and 2nd person pronouns (-&#xa0;33.97%) since the outbreak of the pandemic. Using topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified significant changes in content for the topics Hopelessness (+&#x2009;23.98%), Suicide Methods (+&#x2009;17.11%), Social Support (-&#xa0;14.91%), and Reaching Out to users (-&#xa0;28.97%). Changes in user activity point to an increased expression of mental health issues and decreased engagement with other users. The results indicate a potential shift in communication patterns with more adolescent users expressing their suicidal ideation rather than relating with or supporting other users during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n:::\n</p><br><p>Kostev, K., Hagemann-Goebel, M., Gessler, N., Wohlmuth, P., **Feldhege, J.**, Arnold, D., Jacob, L., Gunawardene, M., H&#xf6;lting, T., Koyanagi, A., Schreiber, R., Smith, L., Sheikhzadeh, S., Wollmer, M. *Is there an association between depression, anxiety disorders and COVID-19 severity and mortality?

This retrospective study was based on anonymized electronic medical data from 50 public healthcare service hospitals across Germany. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to study associations between depression, anxiety and mechanical ventilation and mortality due to COVID adjusted for age, sex, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pre-defined co-diagnoses. Of 28,311 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1970 (6.9%) had a diagnosis of depression and 369 (1.3%) had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder prior to contracting COVID-19. While multivariable logistic regression models did not indicate any association between depression diagnosis and the risk of mechanical ventilation, depression was associated with a decreased risk of mortality (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.94). There was no association between anxiety disorders and risk of mortality, but there was a strong positive association between anxiety disorders and the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.35-3.10). In the present study, depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses were not associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Anxiety disorder was strongly associated with an increased risk of mechanical ventilation. Further studies are needed to clarify how depression and anxiety disorders may influence COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n:::\n</p><br><p>Konermann, F., Gessler, N., Wohlmuth, P., Behr, J., **Feldhege, J.**, Gloeckner, C., Gunawardene, M., Herrlinger, K., Hoelting, T., Pape, U., Reinmuth, N., Stang, A., Sheikhzadeh, S., Arnold, D., Wesseler, C. *High In-Hospital Mortality in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients with Active Cancer Disease during Omicron Phase of the Pandemic: Insights from the CORONA Germany Study.* Oncology Research And Treatment (2023). doi: <https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000529788></p><p>Keywords: *COVID-19; Cancer; Mortality; Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; Adult; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Hospital Mortality; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Neoplasms; Germany*</p><p>::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n## Abstract\nSARS-CoV-2 infected patients with cancer have a worse outcome including a significant higher mortality, compared to non-cancer patients. However, limited data are available regarding in-hospital mortality during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. Therefore, the aim of the study was the comparison of mortality in patients with history of cancer and patients with active cancer disease during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the current Omicron variant of concern. We conducted a multicenter, observational, epidemiological cohort study at 45 hospitals in Germany. Until July 20, 2022, all adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality regarding cancer status (history of cancer and active cancer disease) and SARS-CoV-2 virus type. From March 11, 2020, to July 20, 2022, a total of 27,490 adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included in the study. 2,578 patients (9.4%) had diagnosis of cancer, of whom 1,065 (41.3%) had history of cancer, whereas 1,513 (58.7%) had active cancer disease. Overall 3,749 out of the total of 27,490 patients (13.6%) died during the hospital stay. Patients with active cancer disease had a significantly higher mortality compared to patients without cancer diagnosis, in both phases of the pandemic (wild-type to Delta: OR 1.940 [1.646-2.285]); Omicron: 2.864 [2.354-3.486]). After adjustment to co-variables, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with active cancer disease had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to the other groups, in both phases of the pandemic. The CORONA Germany study indicates that hospitalized patients with active cancer disease are at high risk of death during a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mortality of patients with history of cancer improved to nearly the level of non-cancer patients during Omicron phase.\n:::\n</p><br><p>Dickow, J., Gunawardene, M., Willems, S., **Feldhege, J.**, Wohlmuth, P., Bachmann, M., Bergmann, M., Gesierich, W., Nowak, L., Pape, U., Schreiber, R., Wirtz, S., Twerenbold, R., Sheikhzadeh, S., Gessler, N. *Higher in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant infection compared to influenza infection-Insights from the CORONA Germany study.* Plos One (2023). doi: <https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292017></p><p>::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n## Abstract\nWith the emergence of new subvariants, the disease severity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has attenuated. This study aimed to compare the disease severity in patients hospitalized with omicron variant infection to those with influenza infection. We compared data from the multicenter observational, prospective, epidemiological \"CORONA Germany\" (Clinical Outcome and Risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients) study on patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 to retrospective data on influenza infection cases from November 2016 to August 2022. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 cases were classified as wild-type/delta variant before January 2022, or omicron variant from January 2022 onward. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidities. The study included 35,806 patients from 53 hospitals in Germany, including 4,916 patients (13.7%) with influenza infection, 16,654 patients (46.5%) with wild-type/delta variant infection, and 14,236 patients (39.8%) with omicron variant infection. In-hospital mortality was highest in patients with wild-type/delta variant infection (16.8%), followed by patients with omicron variant infection (8.4%) and patients with influenza infection (4.7%). In the adjusted analysis, higher age was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality (age 80 years vs. age 50 years: OR 4.25, 95% CI 3.10-5.83). Both, patients with wild-type/delta variant infection (OR 3.54, 95% CI 3.02-4.15) and patients with omicron variant infection (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.84) had a higher risk for in-hospital mortality than patients with influenza infection. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, patients with wild-type/delta variant infection had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to patients with influenza infection. Even for patients with omicron variant infection, the adjusted risk for in-hospital mortality was higher than for patients\n:::\n</p><br><p>Wahedi, R., Willems, S., **Feldhege, J.**, Jularic, M., Hartmann, J., Anwar, O., Dickow, J., Harloff, T., Gessler, N., Gunawardene, M. *Pulsed-field versus cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation-Impact of energy source on sedation and analgesia requirement.* Journal Of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). doi: <https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jce.16141></p><p>Keywords: *analgesia; atrial fibrillation; cryoballoon; pulmonary vein isolation; pulsed field ablation; sedation*</p><p>::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"} \n## Abstract\nPulsed field ablation (PFA) represents a novel, nonthermal energy modality that can be applied for single-shot pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in atrial fibrillation (AF). Comparative data with regard to deep sedation to established single-shot modalities such as cryoballoon (CB) ablation are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare a deep sedation protocol in patients receiving PVI with either PFA or CB. Prospective, consecutive AF patients undergoing PVI with a pentaspline PFA catheter were compared to a retrospective CB-PVI cohort of the same timeframe. Study endpoints were the requirements of analgesics, cardiorespiratory stability, and sedation-associated complications. A total of 100 PVI patients were included (PFA n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50, CB n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50, mean age 66&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10.6, 61% male patients, 65% paroxysmal AF). Requirement of propofol, midazolam, and sufentanyl was significantly higher in the PFA group compared to CB [propofol 0.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.04&#x2009;mg/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.04&#x2009;mg/kg/min in CB (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001); midazolam 0.00086&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0004&#x2009;mg/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.0006295&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0003&#x2009;mg/kg/min in CB (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002) and sufentanyl 0.0013&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0007&#x2009;&#xb5;g/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.0008&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.0004&#x2009;&#xb5;g/kg/min in CB (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.0001)]. Sedation-associated complications did not differ between both groups (PFA n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1/50 mild aspiration pneumonia, CB n&#x2009;=&#x2009;0/50, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;.99).
